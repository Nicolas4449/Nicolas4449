- 👋 Hi, I’m @Nicolas4449
- 👀 I'm interested in discovering new APIs..
- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on APIs that I would use regularly if I think I can contribute something.


Hi,

Former Java developer, I continue the development of personal and private tools. In particular, I try to stay up to date with the main technological developments.
Soon I will try to get serious about NodeJS.

Nicolas.
